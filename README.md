## Client Side
In the client directory there are three files. `index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`. They are all linked together so you can start coding

### Setup
Nothing you are good to go

## Server Side
In the server directory you have been given a file called `app.js` and `package.json`.

The `package.json` already contains casual, express and nodemon.

### Setup
run `npm install` from the server directory.

**Remember to use Gitflow**
